This week, I re-scheduled my meeting with Fernando to Monday since
my sister arrived on Friday and I needed to pick her up from the airport.

I am very happy with the Jira Sprint set-up since it keeps me accountable.

That being said, I need to meet with Ming to figure out what a schedule to
hand in everything. 

I am still job searching and it is getting stressfull but it has been 
very productive!

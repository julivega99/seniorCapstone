This week I met with Fernando and we set-up our first sprint. 
It was very productive. I also met Gabby, a woman who works in the company
and is in charge of collecting the data for the Radar. Very productive week.

On the other hand, I asked Ming for an extension on all the assigments
since the job search process has been very demanding. I am still interviewing
with a few companies. I trully appreciate Ming's flexibility.

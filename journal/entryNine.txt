This week, I met with Prof. Ming and concluded that I will be handing in the 
six items missing by the end of the semester. These six items are:

1. Gitlab Source code - This is on the same repo as the journal, but on a
   different folder

2. Risk Assesment 

3. Project Plan - has been completed

4. Competency Proficiency Deomo

5. Design Doc

6. Proof of Concept Demo and Project Status Presentation


Additionally, I would like to meet with Prof. Ming to discuss the database 
with him (Fernando asked for this as well). I will email him ASAP.

On the other hand, Fernando and I have been meeting weekly, completing our 
sprints, and I have been learning a lot from him. I am very excited to be 
working in BuenTrip and feel part of the broader team. 

It has been a crazy semester but a good one.

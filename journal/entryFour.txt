Today I had a very productive meeting with Fernando; we set up
a meeting for next friday and several to-do items until then. 

TO-DO

- Create a Jira account and add Fernando as a contributor
- Decide on a database to use
    - Most likely mongoDB Atlas
- Decide on a backend
    - Most likely django or strapi.io + AWS
    - Check AWS student allowance
- Create a few user stories for our first sprint meeting
    - Scrum

Today, I met with Ming to discuss my projects progress. 

It has been slow. 

I am meeting with Fernando tomorrow; I tried to set a meeting last
week but he was busy with a conference for Ecuadorian startups. 
I could not make it to the conference because of class, but I am 
looking forward to watch the recordings.

During my meeting with Ming, we discussed the deliverables for this
semester. We decided that the goal is to have the database constructed
and a search function by the end of the semester. Figuring this out gives
me a north and a goal.

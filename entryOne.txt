The beginning of project has been a whirlwind. I was unsure of what I wanted to do from the beginning. Until I stumbled upon Fernando Rivera. Fernando works at Buen Trip Hub, an Ecuadorian accelerator, and after a brief conversation, he agreed to be my mentor.

How do I describe my project? As the Ecuadorian version of Crunchbase. Buen Trip Hub has been collecting data on Ecuadorian startups for the past decade. They want to create a platform that showcases this information and allows startups to connect with investors and with each other. That is where I come in. 

The goal of my capstone is to create a smaller-scale version of this platform with scalability potential. 

These past few weeks have entailed a lot of brainstorming. Not only have I had to submit two “deliverables”, but I have had to familiarize myself with what Crunchbase is. It is hard not to get overwhelmed with the size of this project. 

I have to remind myself to take deep breaths and that I don’t have to build it all at once, it consists of building small parts that will eventually create a whole. 

The tech recruitment season has not made things easier. It definitely has consumed my compSci energy. 

In the next few weeks, I will meet with Fernando again to keep brainstorming and come up with a game plan. I am looking forward to it.

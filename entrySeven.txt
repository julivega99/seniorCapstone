This week, I met with Fernando on Monday. We had a very productive
mid-sprint review. My sprint review has been moved to Wednesday November 18th.

During this meeting I met with Carmen, the director of BuenTrip, she is a
super cool person and helped me figure out various other user stories! This was super exciting and very insightfull.

I still need to meet with Ming, and have put it on my todo list for the next 
two weeks. Let's hope he doesn't kill me!
